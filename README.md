Luhn Algorithm
This is a program that I ran on racket aka Drracket.
To input a number place it as (algo number) and the result will be true or false.
Make sure to enter a 16 digit number.

Another way to input is:
(algo 'number)

Multiple numbers:
(map algo '(number1 number2))

if you use Drracket, please include 
#lang racket
above to define the language
below you can copy and paste the code
